* CANCELED it seems like this could be a datagrid app

  especially after we write some hooks. that would relieve me from
  coming up with an interface. we need an interface anyway, though,
  for users.
* CANCELED we might as well just use srfi-69 as the database
  CLOSED: [2010-07-05 Mon 15:43]
  why do some dumbass sqlite3-thing? what are we indexing by: user?
  problem is: how do we serialize a srfi-69 hash-table? right: use
  fucking alists.

  where's our fucking alist-lib, again? jesus, we need that thing.

  oh, shit: on the other hand, we're going to incur this penalty every
  read! we need something spritely, then. damn; also: usernames are
  going to have to be unique across domains unless we do something
  clever. damn, i really don't want to have to program this.
